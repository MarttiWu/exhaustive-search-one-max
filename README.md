# exhaustive-search-one-max

The one-max problem is a basic problem.
Given a bit string of  0's and 1's, the aim is to find a bit string which contains the most 1's.

# Usage

1. Run directly in the terminal by typing the following:
    #./main [algo] [runs] [iter] [bits] [filename]
    ./main es 1 20000 100 ""
    
2. Or if you want to run multiple times, just by opening the search.sh and add whatever you want to run.  

# Customize

You can change the iteration block by modifying "const int block=100;" in execute.h
